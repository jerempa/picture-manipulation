# Description

This script iterates over the current working directory, and scans for jpeg files. The jpeg files are changed to A6 size (300 PPI), and a 3 millimetre white border is added to each picture. The new A6 pictures are saved separately in a new directory as JPEG and PDF. The PDF versions are also merged together to a one PDF file called "result.pdf".

## Use case

There was a need to do some simple picture manipulation to hundreds of pictures, and this script was used instead of manually doing the task.
